üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Install FortiGate VM in VirtualBox

1. Download the FortiGate VM
You need a .qcow2 (for KVM) or .vmdk (for VMware) FortiGate VM image.
If you only find .out files (bare metal firmware), it won't work ‚Äî you need a VM image.
Best: Download the KVM version (.qcow2) or VMware version (.vmdk).

2. Prepare the Image for VirtualBox
VirtualBox cannot directly use .qcow2 images. You must convert it to a .vdi or .vmdk format:
If it's .qcow2:

sudo apt install qemu-utils    # if needed
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vdi fortios.qcow2 fortios.vdi
If it's already .vmdk, you can use it directly.

3. Create a New Virtual Machine in VirtualBox
Type: Linux
Version: Other Linux (64-bit)
Memory: Allocate at least 1024 MB RAM (preferably 2048 MB or more).
Hard Disk:
Choose "Use an existing virtual disk file"
Select your converted fortigate.vdi or original .vmdk.

4. Set up the Network Interfaces
FortiGate expects multiple NICs (usually at least 2: one for WAN, one for LAN).
In Settings ‚ûî Network:
Adapter 1: Bridged Adapter or NAT (for Internet access).
Adapter 2+: Internal Network or Host-only Adapter (for LAN simulation).

‚ö° Important: Set network adapters to virtio-net or Intel PRO/1000 MT Server for best compatibility.

5. Other Settings
Disable Audio (not needed).
Processor: Give at least 1 CPU; 2 CPUs recommended.
Acceleration: Ensure VT-x/AMD-V is enabled.
Storage: No optical drive needed ‚Äî just boot off the FortiGate virtual disk.

6. First Boot
Start the VM.
It should boot to the FortiGate CLI (FortiGate-VM64 login: prompt).
Default credentials:
Username: admin
Password: (blank) ‚Üí just press Enter.
First time login will ask you to set a new password.

7. Access the Web GUI (Optional but Recommended)
Once it‚Äôs running:
Find which network interface is your mgmt interface (usually port1).
Set an IP if needed:
config system interface
  edit port1
    set ip 192.168.1.99/24
    set allowaccess ping https ssh http fgfm
  next
end
Then browse to https://192.168.1.99/ in your browser.
